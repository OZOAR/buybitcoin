                      <p>When Bitcoin was first introduced, it could be mined even on a regular laptop using a central processor (CPU).</p>
                      <p>Competition increased and GPU was used for more revenue. They produced higher hash rates with good energy efficiency and affordable devices.</p>
                      <p>The cost of bitcoin and the difficulty of mining continued to rise, and ASIC replaced GPU. Powerful and easy-to-use devices instantly became popular.</p>
                      <p>The number of miners increased steadily. Consequently, the complexity grew and, over time, it was possible to catch a block already once a month or even once a year (depending on the complexity and luck). As a result, miners began to cooperate into groups (pools) and share founded bitcoins according to capacity. </p>

     <div class="row" style="padding-top: 20px;">
       <div class="col-12">
         <p><b>Mining pool</b> is a combination of the miners  hash power in order to increase the probability of finding a block. The prize for the block obtained by the pool is distributed to all miners.</p>
         <p><b>How does the pool work?</b><br> Miners' hash power is connected to the pool which in turn pays the miner’s fee according to the accepted rules.
          The pool earns on the fees from coins mined by participants. Typically, pool fees range from 1% to 5%.</p>
         <p><b>Mining pool principle</b><br>The principle of the mining pool is no different from the solo - from many connected to the pool miners only one finds the block, but all of them are searching for it. In order to determine the contribution of each miner and calculate his reward correctly stratum protocol was created. This protocol gives tasks to miners to calculate the block, but with reduced complexity. As soon as the miner finds a solution with more complexity than the given - the solution goes to the pool. This is called a share - essentially a small block. The share can also be more complex than the complexity of the network - then it is a block solution. Pool calculates the contribution of each miner based on the number of the sent shares and their complexity.</p>
        <p><b>What parameters should be considered when choosing a pool?</b></p>
        <p>First of all, you need to choose a mining pool with a larger percentage of hashrate. Such mining pools enjoy overall strength, partnerships with large mining farms, and trust from the majority of miners. Mining pools with many years of good reputation generally have a long history.</p>
        <p>Second, choose one with a good reputation. Good products and services bring good reputation, which reflects a mining pool’s overall strength and its resources accumulated in the industry.</p>
        <p>Third, choose a mining pool that offers much convenience in mining, withdrawing and selling tokens, which is particularly important in extreme market conditions.</p>

        <h2>Which Countries Mine the most Bitcoins?</h2>
        <p>Recently mining has been associated with China.
          Electricity in China is very cheap and has allowed Chinese Bitcoin miners to gain a very large percentage of Bitcoin’s hash power.
          The largest hardware manufacturers (Bitmain, Canaan, Bang, Innosilicon) and pools are registered in China (ViaBTC, BTC.com, Antpool, F2Pool).</p>
        <p>However, in the USA the industry is also developing actively and in some respects is significantly ahead of China, Russia and other mining centers.</p>
        <p>Interest in cryptocurrencies in the United States is present at all levels - from the main financial regulator, the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) ending with ordinary buyers for whom about 1,300 cryptomats are installed in all states.</p>
        <p><b>Mining in the US is gaining momentum</b></p>
        <p>4,100 billion kWh of electricity is generated annually in the United States. This is almost 1/5 of the world's electricity production, second place after China.</p>
        <p>About 65% of electricity is generated by thermal power plants running on fossil fuels (37% on coal, 27% on natural gas and 1% on oil). 19% give out nuclear power plants, 7% - hydroelectric power plants. About 6% is obtained from renewable energy sources.</p>
        <p>The US does not have enough of its own resources. Electricity imports amount to about 45-50 billion kW/h annually. However, due to the uneven distribution of energy sources, there are locations with a surplus of generated electricity. This is a great opportunity for launching new projects.</p>
        <p>For example, the North Georgia Data project. The project developers promise to use from 5.5 MW and reach 100 MW within eight months. Now they managed to get the price of electricity in the amount of $ 0.057 per kW/h.</p>
        <p>With a favorable tariff you get a long-term project in a country with loyal legislation, ownership rights and maximum degree of protection. Considering mining as a long-term project (from 4-5 years), the United States is the place where you need to start an enterprise.</p>

      <h2>Pool Concentration in China</h2>
                  <p>Before we get into the best mining pools to join, it’s important to note that most mining pools are in China. Many only have Chinese websites and support. Mining centralization in China is one of Bitcoin’s biggest issues at the moment.
                      <br><br>
                      There are about 20 major mining pools. Broken down by the percent of hash power controlled by a pool, and the location of that pool’s company, we estimate that Chinese pools control ~65% of the network hash rate:

                      Network of each cryptocurrency has such a parameter as "block creation time" (For bitcoin it is 10 minutes).<br>
                      How to hold this option regardless of how many miners are connected to the network? Because if there are many miners, they will find blocks too often, and if there are few of them, the blocks will be rare and network transactions will go very long.<br>
                      If miners produce empty blocks and receive money for it, the coin will depreciate, and if blocks are found slowly -  transactions will be stopped and, again, the coin will depreciate.<br>
                      This is where complexity begins to work. In simple terms, it is a challenge that miners have to solve to create a block, and it can change. The complexity depends on the hashrate network (the number of miners connected to the coin). If there are few miners - complexity falls, if there are many miners - complexity begins to grow and it starts to be more difficult for one particular miner to find the block.<br>
                      Complexity is measured in hash (usually terrahash - TH), applied to mining it is a unit of work performed. Network capacity (number of miners) is measured in hash per second (TH/s). Network itself adjusts the complexity in such a way that Complexity/Network Capacity = Time for the next block.

                      PPS - simple payment per share

                    <p>FPPS - full payment per share<br></p>
                    <p>Most popular payment systems: PPS/PPS+/PPLNS/FPPS </p>
                    <p><b>PPS — (Pay Per Share)</b> - payment for each share. When using PPS miner receives a reward for each share accepted by the pool, regardless of whether the pool finds blocks. In this case, the pool determines the cost of each share independently based on the network complexity, network reward, block time, and the pool's own capacity.</p>
                    <p><b>PPLNS (Pay Per Last N Shares)</b> — payment for the last N shares. Unlike PPS, there is no fixed fee for each share. The payment for PPLNS per round is similar to PROP, it is charged in proportion to the shares received, but with one big difference. A decreasing coefficient that changes from 0 to 1  with an increase in the sent shares is applied to the yours sent shares.
                      The number of shares used to calculate PPLNS for all pools is different and strongly depends on the cryptocurrency. PPLNS encourages miners for long-term continuous mining.</p>
                    <p><b>PPS+</b> is a combined pool payment method that combines standard PPS and PPLNS. Fixed block reward is distributed according to the PPS algorithm and commissions included in the block are distributed according to the PPLNS principle.</p>
                    <p><b>FPPS (Full Pay-per-Share)</b> - similar to PPS+, but the commission included in the block is paid on the principle of PPS, not PPLNS.</p>

                      Blockchain is the basis of cryptocurrency. In order to understand what mining is, you have to understand what blockchain is firstly.<br>
                      Blocks are the data about transactions within a system that are presented in cryptographic form. All the blocks are in a chain, so they’re connected. <br>
                      Blockchain can be described as a database that stores all movements of virtual coins and information about all ever-existing wallets. All of this is specifically encrypted to create a chain of blocks and decomposed into millions of miners' computers. You can’t change anything in a block, because you also have to change the next block and every block till the end of the chain.<br>
                      All blocks contain certain data and weigh 1 mb. Each block of the chain contains a specific key. And until it is decrypted, the block will not close. Once the cryptographic key to the block (hash) is found, the block closes and a new one is added. Miners look for new blocks and are rewarded for them. Blockchain operations and security are provided by miners.<br>

                        <p>1. A decided to transfer a certain amount of money to B. Before money reaches B they get to Mempool.<br>
                          Mempool is the location of unprocessed transactions awaiting confirmation.
                          (At this stage your payment was initiated and started to be tested for compliance with certain technical regulations, but it has not yet been recorded in any copy of the blockchain. The transaction is not yet confirmed.)
                          </p>
                        <p>2. Miners take a transaction for which a good reward is offered from the mempool and transfer it to the block. This transaction must then be confirmed by at least three other participants.
                          (The higher the transaction commission, the faster miners confirm it.)</p>
                        <p>
                          3. Once miners have confirmed the transaction, the money reaches the recipient.
                          Miners receive the reward for the new block, now it is 6,25 BTC.
                          Miner income = voluntary transaction fees + reward for the block.</p>

As a result, miners began to cooperate into groups (pools) and share founded bitcoins according to capacity. </p>
